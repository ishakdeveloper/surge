 *
 * Three things to change on a fork: the repository below, the domain each
 * environment answers on, and the project name at the bottom.
 *
 * Note that Railway's IaC API is in beta and its own README says it will change.
 * The stable alternative is a `railway.json` per app, which covers build and
 * deploy settings but cannot create the database or the services — which is most
 * of what makes this worth having.

 * the desired state. `process.env` is readable here — the runner passes the
 * shell straight through — but a plan that depends on it stops being
 * reproducible, and a CI drift check has nothing fixed to compare against. This
 * changes once, when you fork.
 *
 * Nor is it worth hiding. A repository path is not a secret: it is already in
 * your git remote, and Railway will not read it without the GitHub
 * authorization the connection grants. `preserve()` below is for the values
 * that genuinely are secret.

   * Railway does not give a new service a public domain on its own, and this

   * "Custom-domain registration is not supported by Railway configuration". So
   * domains are added in the dashboard either way, and what this decides is

   * API to call. Name a domain you have pointed at Railway and the addresses
   * are settled before the first deploy instead.

   * sends the session cookie between two origins only if it considers them
   * same-site, which needs both under one parent and `AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN`
   * scoped to it. `up.railway.app` is a public suffix, so two generated hosts
   * can never qualify however they are configured — a split deployment needs a

/**
 * Tracing, when somewhere is configured to receive it.
 *
 * `RULES.md` tells contributors not to add manual logging on error paths
 * because "OTEL spans already capture failures and context". That was only true
 * of the spans themselves — nothing exported them, so the context existed and
 * went nowhere. This is the other half.
 *
 * The exporter is installed only when `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set, and
 * off is the honest default for a boilerplate: an exporter pointed at nothing
 * retries on a schedule and fills the log with connection failures.
 *
 * That decision is made by *omitting* `spanProcessor` rather than by returning
 * an empty layer. `NodeSdk.layer` already installs a tracer only when it has a
 * processor, and a branch that returns `Layer.empty` types the whole thing as
 * providing nothing — so nothing depends on it, and it is never built at all.
 *
 * `Effect.withSpan` and `Effect.fn` are what produce the spans; this only
 * decides where they go.
